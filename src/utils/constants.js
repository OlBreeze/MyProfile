//     - ðŸ‘€ I graduated from a humanities gymnasium and entered the aviation university, after which I became interested in
//      programming and participated in the full cycle of project development for the financial sector of an energy company.
//      I worked as an Oracle database administrator for more than ten years.
//      At some point, I was offered a large project for the development of accounting programs on 1C.
//      I led and supported more than 20 companies, received a huge number of thanks and positive reviews.
//       Now I am engaged in software development on Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Redux...
//
//     -  I'm currently learning course Full Stack Java at Tel-Ran. I'm excited about gaining hands-on experience and
//      deepening my understanding of software development processes.
//
//     -  I'm looking for opportunities to collaborate on interesting projects that allow me to develop my skills
//      and apply my knowledge in practice.
//      I'm also interested in internships where I can gain valuable experience and contribute to a team.
//      If you have any ideas or suggestions, Iâ€™d be happy to discuss!
//
//     - âš¡ Fun fact: When I read Arthur Hailey's book Airport I dreamed of becoming a pilot.
//       I was accepted into the aviation institute without a competition and was
//       quite surprised to learn that after graduation, I would become an engineer, not a pilot!

//         "How do you handle tight deadlines when you have multiple tasks to complete?\n",
//     answer1: "Hello everyone! :) \n" +
//         "My workday usually starts with analyzing the current tasks. \n" +
//         "The most urgent tasks are the first ones I take on â€” these are usually tasks related to critical functionality. \n" +
//         "Next, I tackle the fastest tasks. These tasks make our clients happy: they see a quick resolution to their issue and are pleased with the result. These tasks make us happy too! :) After that, I can enjoy some coffee. \n" +
//         "The next set of tasks are those planned for long-term implementation, with complex logic that takes a sprint or more to complete. At this stage, itâ€™s best to reach some logical checkpoint, so that the next day, less time is spent figuring out the algorithms and code."
